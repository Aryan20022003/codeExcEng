# Execution Engine: A Containerized Code Execution Platform

## Project Overview

The **Execution Engine** is designed to execute large volumes of foreign code securely in containerized environments. Leveraging **Docker** for isolation and **Bull MQ** for task queuing, this system ensures each code submission runs in an isolated container without network access, preventing unauthorized actions. This project highlights backend technologies like **message queues**, **workers**, and **containerization**, showcasing scalable and secure systems.

### Key Features

- **Execution in Isolated Environments**: Code runs within Docker containers, providing complete isolation from the host system.
- **No Network Access**: Containers have no network access, ensuring secure execution of potentially untrusted code.
- **Cloud Output Storage**: Execution logs (stdout and stderr) are saved to Google Cloud Storage, providing scalable and secure access to output.
- **C++ Support**: Currently supports C++ code execution, with plans for future support of additional languages.
  
### Technologies Used

- **Docker**: Containerization to securely run user-submitted code in isolated environments.
- **Docker Compose**: Orchestrates multiple services locally for simplified setup.
- **Bull MQ**: Built on Redis, it manages execution queues and processes tasks efficiently.
- **Redis**: Message broker for handling job queues.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for storing job metadata and execution results.
- **Google Cloud Storage**: Used to store and retrieve execution outputs securely.

### System Architecture

1. **Bull MQ**: Manages task queues, distributing execution jobs to worker processes running in isolated threads.
2. **Docker Containers**: Ensure code execution is secure and sandboxed, with no network access and limited system resources.
3. **Worker Threads**: Handles CPU-bound execution tasks efficiently in a scalable, responsive architecture.

## API Endpoints

### 1. **`/api/v1/submission` (POST)**
Submit code via file upload.
- **Request**: 
  - Method: `POST`
  - Type: `multipart/form-data`
  - Field: `sourceCode` (file)
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "message": "File uploaded and pushed to queue successfully",
    "id": "<id>",
    "fileName": "<fileName with extension>"
  }
  ```

### 2. **`/api/v1/submission/url` (POST)**
Submit code by providing a URL to the file.
- **Request**: 
  - Method: `POST`
  - Type: `application/json`
  - Body: `{ "url": "<url_link_of_file>" }`
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "message": "File uploaded and pushed to queue successfully",
    "id": "<id>",
    "fileName": "<fileName with extension>"
  }
  ```

### 3. **`/api/v1/submission/url` (GET)**
Get the output link after code execution.
- **Request**: 
  - Method: `GET`
  - Query Parameter: `id`
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Executed URL fetched successfully",
    "codeId": "<id>",
    "executedUrl": "<downloadable url expires in 30 min>"
  }
  ```

## Local Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Ensure you have **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed.
2. You need to mount your `serviceAccount.js` file, which contains Firebase configurations (such as `config`, `storageBucket`, `firebase database url`, and `uploadDestination`).

   - Place the `serviceAccount.js` file in the `/home/aryan/judge0/config/` directory. If you donâ€™t have it, copy and modify `/config/serviceAccountDemo.js` with your Firebase credentials.

   The relevant volume setup in `docker-compose.yml`:

   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - /home/aryan/judge0:/app/judge0
     - /home/aryan/judge0/config/serviceAccount.js:/app/judge0/config/serviceAccount.js
     - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
   ```

3. Ensure that the `storageBucket` in `serviceAccount.js` matches your Firebase bucket address, and the `firebase database url` is set to your Firebase Realtime Database.

4. Start the services by running:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

## Future Enhancements

- **Support for More Languages**: The engine currently supports only C++. Future updates will include support for additional programming languages.
- **Real-Time Resource Monitoring**: Implementing real-time resource monitoring for containers, enforcing strict CPU and memory limits during code execution.

This project reflects my passion for backend development, utilizing containerization, message queues, and concurrency to build secure, scalable systems. Future updates will continue to enhance the system's capabilities and performance.
